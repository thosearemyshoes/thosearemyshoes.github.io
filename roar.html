                    <p class="lead">The Roaring Twenties brought many inventions and the finacial prosperity to make life easier, more exciting, and enjoyable. </p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">
                        <br> There were many <strong>new conviences</strong> that came about in the 1920s. There were things such as <strong>refridgerators.</strong> The Frigidaire Company developed the first self-contained fridge unit for the home in 1923.

                        <br> In addition to the refridgerator, there was also the convienience of <strong>off-the-rack clothing.</strong> Instead of women being tied to their sewing machines day in and day out, off the rack clothing became more popular and affordable. This would free up a lot of time and work for a lot of women.
                        <br> With the advent of new convieninces, new recreation sprang up. Soon there were <strong>Flappers.</strong> Flappers were party girls and were looked down upon by “decent” society. These Flappers commonly would hang out around jazz clubs and vaudeville shows.

                        <br> To further show the prosperity of Americans in the 1920s, <strong>automobiles</strong> beccame something the average American family could afford. The Model T was the first (consumer) car and such was the most popular car.

                        <br> The <abbr title="Women's Christan Temperance Union">WCTU</abbr>, was a society whose beliefs centered around the thought that alcohol was evil. <strong>Prohibition</strong>, the banning of all alcohol, began in the year 1919. This lasted for 13 years, 10 months, 19 days, 17 hours and 32.5 minutes. This made the cruise industry very popular, by taking "cruises to nowhere" just so people could drink legally. Moonshiners, people makming illegal alcohol, sprang up in many backwoods areas.

                        <br> Despite all the prosperity, people still wanted to buy more than they can afford. This brought along the system of <strong>credit.</strong> Credit is the system of being able to have something now, but pay later. Because of this, credit caused many Americans to go into debt,<img width="245" height="192.63" style="float:right;" src="http://9f1780.medialib.glogster.com/media/51673841d4cc40ff036149219bd8db3bc50944873dda004e67063ba0f41122c2/cotton-club-2.jpg"> and it still does this today.

                        <br>
                        <strong>Music</strong> also expanded in the 1920s. Jazz and Ragtime, popular dance tunes, sprang up in many bars and pool halls. Flappers had a great time with this. Music was one of the direct causes of the <strong>Harlem Renaissance</strong>. The Harlem Renaissance was a time when a barrage of great artists, writers, and other people all came to the Harlem Neighborhoods in Manhattan. This caused a lot of jazz clubs to spring up, a ton of people to tell their stories, and a whole bunch of other things. This would advance the USA into the golden age peroid that it had until the Great Depression.
