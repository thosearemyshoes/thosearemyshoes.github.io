This attack was a complete ambush and 2,500 military men lost their lives. It was after the attack on Pearl Harbor that FDR declared war with these famous words:

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align:left;"> Because of the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor there was a lot of distrust of anyone of Japanese descent including Japanese-Americans. Japanese-Americans, many of whom had never even been to Japan, were forced into <strong>internment camps</strong>. Life was harsh and unfair for these citizens of the United States. This was a dark day in America's history.

Hundreds of thousands of people were killed instantly, and those that lived had permanent injuries and radation sickness. These bombs ushered in the end of World War 2.
