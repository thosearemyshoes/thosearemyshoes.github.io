                    <p class="lead">Soon all the prosperity of the 1920s came crashing down. The Great Depression brought terrible poverty, hardships, and struggles. The New Deal was created to alleviate the economic and social hardships of the Great Depression.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align:left"> Poor farming techniques, where the same ground was plowed over and over, and a long severe drought led to the <strong>Dust Bowl</strong> of the 1930s. A terrible wind storm blew acres and acres of dirt all over the midwest. Farming became impossible. People left their farms in search of work.

                        <br> On October 29<sup>th</sup>, 1929 the <strong>stock market crashed</strong>. Speculators abused the stock market, created fear in people, and millions of people sold their stock at the same time at very low prices causing the crash.
                        <br><q>As a young man, I lived through the Great Depression, when banks failed and so many lost their jobs and homes and went hungry. I was fortunate to have a job at a canning factory that paid 25 cents an hour.</q> -James E. Faust. Because of the stock market crash, many <strong>banks failed.</strong>

                        <br> <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong>, a common farm boy from Iowa, became president on March 4<sup>th</sup>, 1929. His presidency directly preceded the Great Depression. Therefore, many people blamed him for all of the troubles.

                        <strong> Franklin Delano Roosevelt</strong> was a very popular president. He was elected and reelected for the presidency 4 seperate times. FDR implemented the <strong>New Deal</strong>. The Focus of the new deal was <strong>Relief, Recovery and Reform</strong>. Economic assitance was given to the very poor, job programs were started, and polices were put in place to ensure better fiscal oversight of state and federal tax money and programs. FDR started the <strong>Works Progress Administration</strong> (WPA) which <q>built traditional infrastructure of the New Deal such as roads, bridges, schools, courthouses, hospitals, sidewalks, waterworks, and post-offices, but also constructed museums, swimming pools, parks, community centers, playgrounds, coliseums, markets, fairgrounds, tennis courts, zoos, botanical gardens, auditoriums, waterfronts, city halls, gyms, and university unions. Most of these are still in use today.</q> <sup><abbr title="Leighninger, Robert D">1</abbr></sup>.<img src="https://philebersole.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/depressiongdp.gif" hieght="300" width="388" style="">
